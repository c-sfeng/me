In the future, I hope to turn my hobbies into something more, as I maintain both a personal and professional portfolio in photography. Additionally, I'm exploring design, film-making and audio-visual production not just in a personal capacity, but also as a Media Director in UNSW's Computer Science and Engineering Society.
