          Hi, Iâ€™m Clarence, a 2nd year Science and Computer Science
          student at the University of New South Wales, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
          Additionally, I currently work as an academic tutor, and as a front and back-end software enineer intern at
          Intuit Australia. 
        </p>
        <p className="primary-text">
          When I'm not studying or working, I'll be reading, watching films or taking photos.
          In the future, I hope to turn my hobbies into something more, as I 
          maintain both a personal and professional portfolio in 
          photography, and I'm exploring design, film-making and audio-visual
          production not just in a personal capacity, but also as a Media Director in UNSW's Computer Science 
          and Engineering Society. If you'd like to know more about what I've done, you'll find more details below.
          Thanks for visiting!
